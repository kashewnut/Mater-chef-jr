Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.

Combine flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, salt and baking powder in a bowl. Add butter and cut in using 2 knives or a pastry blender until the butter is pea-sized. Add egg and egg white to flour mixture and stir with a fork just until combined. Sir in ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time, just until dough forms.

Turn dough onto prepared baking sheet and pat into an 8” disk. Sprinkle the top with 1 tablespoon sugar; press lightly. Bake at 350F for 12 minutes or until set in the middle and browned on the edges. Transfer on parchment from baking sheet to a wire rack. Cool to room temperature.

Combine strawberries and the remaining tablespoon sugar in a bowl; let stand 15 minutes. Slice shortcake into 8 wedges. Top each with whipped cream and strawberries. Layer with second piece of shortbread and top with more cream and berries. Serve immediately.
